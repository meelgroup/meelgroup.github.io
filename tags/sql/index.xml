      <description>This post compiles many years of work, done by numerous resarchers. The research paper for CrystalBall is available here (accepted to SAT&amp;#8217;2019) and the code is available here. Build instructions are at the bottom of the post. Part 2 will deal with exploring the data in more detail.
I always had a fascination with data when it comes to SAT solving. My SAT solver, CryptoMiniSat always had very detailed stats printed to the console.</description>
