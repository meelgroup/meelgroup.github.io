      <description>UniGen is a hashing-based algorithm to generate uniform samples subject to given set of constraints. The primary application of UniGen is in random stimuli generation for hardware and software verification. The current version of the tool has been developed over the years and is parallelizable without losing theoretical guarantees.

      <description>ApproxMC is a hashing-based algorithm for approximate discrete integration over finite domains and provides ($\epsilon$,$\delta$) guarantees. This implementation handles the case when the function is implicitely defined by SAT formula. To the best of our knowledge, the current implementation has the best runtime performance among approximate counting algorithms. We are actively improving algorithm as well as implementation and would love to hear your feedback.

      <description>WeightMC is hashing-based algorithm for weighted counting (discrete integration) over Boolean domains. It takes a CNF formula and weight function as inputs and returns weighted count. In contrast to previous attempts to develop weighted counting that rely on use of Optimization oracles, WeightMC only uses feasibility oracle. A simple reworking of this algorithm was used by Belle et al to predicate delays in UK transportation network.
