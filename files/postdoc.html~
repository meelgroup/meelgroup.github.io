<h1>Post-Doctoral Positions for Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning</h1> <br><br>
<p>Multiple post-doctoral research positions available in the project on 
"Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning," focused on 
developing formal methods for AI techniques and also employ advances in 
AI techniques for the development of formal methods. <br><br>
  
Broadly, the project is sub-divided into four major themes (detailed 
description available  at https://meelgroup.github.io/):

Theme 1: Revisiting NP Revolution: New Paradigms for SAT/SMT/MaxSAT Solvers

Theme 2: Beyond NP Revolution: Constrained Sampling and 
Integration/Counting

Theme 3: Verification of AI Systems

Theme 4: Interpretable and Explainable Explanations for AI Systems

We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; 
therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area 
and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, 
algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding are crucial to 
make a significant contribution to our research.

<p>
Two post-doctoral research fellow positions in the area of SAT/CP/AI are available at the School of Computing <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">(http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg)</a>, National University of Singapore, Singapore.<br><br>
 
The research will be primarily in the broad areas of SAT and CP with relevance to Artificial Intelligence. Some areas of focus include sampling and discrete integration techniques, optimization techniques, modelling, and machine learning for CP/SAT. The positions will be for 1 year with appointment date in 2019 but a longer period may be possible.<br><br>
 
<u>Job requirements:</u><br>
1. A PhD in CS or related disciplines such as ECE, Mathematics, and OR.<br>
2. Research experience in implementing solvers, modelling problems and applying SAT/CP techniques.<br><br>
 
Jointly supervised by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/">Kuldeep S. Meel</a> and <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ryap/">Roland Yap</a>.<br><br>

<u>How to apply:</u><br>
Interested candidates should send their resume and statement about their research to Kuldeep Meel <a href="mailto:meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg">(meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg)</a> or Roland Yap <a href="mailto:ryap@comp.nus.edu.sg">(ryap@comp.nus.edu.sg)</a>.  Please also include a plan of research. While there is flexibility in research direction, please also take into account the areas of focus listed above. <br>
