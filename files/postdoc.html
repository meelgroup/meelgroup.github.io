<h1>Post-Doctoral Positions for Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning</h2> 
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
Multiple post-doctoral
research positions available in the project on "Provably Verified and
Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning," focused on developing formal
methods for AI techniques and also employ advances in AI techniques
for the development of formal methods. <br>
  
Broadly, the project is sub-divided into four major themes (detailed
description available
at <a href="https://meelgroup.github.io/#research">(https://meelgroup.github.io/#research)</a>
https://meelgroup.github.io/#research): <br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
Theme 1: Revisiting NP Revolution: New Paradigms for SAT/SMT/MaxSAT Solvers<br><br>

Theme 2: Beyond NP Revolution: Constrained Sampling and 
Integration/Counting<br><br>

Theme 3: Verification of AI Systems<br><br>

Theme 4: Interpretable and Explainable Explanations for AI Systems<br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; 
therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area 
and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, 
algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding are crucial to 
make a significant contribution to our research.

<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
Two post-doctoral research fellow positions in the area of SAT/CP/AI
are available at the School of
Computing <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">(http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg)</a>,
National University of Singapore, Singapore.<br><br>
 
The research will be primarily in the broad areas of SAT and CP with
relevance to Artificial Intelligence. Some areas of focus include
sampling and discrete integration techniques, optimization techniques,
modelling, and machine learning for CP/SAT. The positions will be for
1 year with appointment date in 2019 but a longer period may be
possible.<br><br>
 
<u>Job requirements:</u><br>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
1. A Ph.D. in CS or related disciplines such as ECE, Mathematics, and OR.<br>
2. Research experience in implementing solvers, modeling problems, and 
applying SAT/CP techniques.<br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
<u>Procedure:</u><br>
Interested candidates should
email <a href="mailto:meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg">meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
with a PDF of CV, which must contain information of at least two
references.  Furthermore, a short write up indicating your interest in
a particular theme is required. <br><br>

The initial term of appointment will be one year extensible for another 
year, upon review of satisfactory performance.<br><br>

The selected candidates will be offered competitive salaries and benefits.<br><br>
