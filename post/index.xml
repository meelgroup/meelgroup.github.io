      <description>This post compiles many years of work, done by numerous resarchers. The research paper for CrystalBall is available here (accepted to SAT&amp;#8217;2019) and the code is available here. Build instructions are at the bottom of the post. Part 2 will deal with exploring the data in more detail.
I always had a fascination with data when it comes to SAT solving. My SAT solver, CryptoMiniSat always had very detailed stats printed to the console.</description>

      <description>This blogpost is based on our (Shubham, Rahul, Subhajit and Kuldeep) paper that got published in the procedings of International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR), 2018. The code is available here. The primary contribution of this work is marrying knowledge compilation with uniform sampling to design a new uniform sampler KUS. The main result is that KUS is able to solve more number of benchmarks than existing state-of-the-art uniform and almost-uniform samplers beating them by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime: Uniform Sampling</description>
