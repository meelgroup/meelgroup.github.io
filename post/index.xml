      <description>This blogpost is based on our (Shubham, Rahul, Subhajit and Kuldeep) paper that got published in the procedings of International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR), 2018. The code is available here. The primary contribution of this work is marrying knowledge compilation with uniform sampling to design a new uniform sampler KUS. The main result is that KUS is able to solve more number of benchmarks than existing state-of-the-art uniform and almost-uniform samplers beating them by orders of magnitude in terms of runtime: Uniform Sampling</description>

      <description>We are happy to release our ANF and CNF simplifier and converter called Bosphorus. It has helped us break multiple real-world ciphers. It has been re-released with major work by Davin Choo &amp; Kian Ming A. Chai from DSO National Laboratories Singapore and Mate Soos &amp; Kuldeep Meel from NUS. The paper will be published at the DATE 2019 conference.
ANFs and CNFs Algebraic Normal Form is a form that is used by most cryptographers to describe symmetric ciphers, hash algorithms, and lately a lot of post-quantum asymmetric ciphers.</description>
